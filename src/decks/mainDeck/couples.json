        "How well do you know your partner? How well do they\n know you? The Couples Edition is meant to explore\n how well you already know each other and unlock\n the layers you never knew existed.\n\n This game can be played on its own or with the original\n We're not Really Strangers card game. Alternatively asking\n and answering each question, starting with Level 1 all the\n way up to Level 3. Honest answers only.\n\n Ready?\n\nLevel 1 (Perception):\n\n Level 1 is about gaining perspective on how\n your significant other sees you and challenging any\n assumptions you make about each other. It's also a test\n of how well you two know one another.\n\n",

These are meant\n to be spontaneous and a lotta bit silly. These cards can appear at any moment during the game!",

        "Things to remember\n while playing:\n\n 1. Relationships change just\n like people in them do.\n Continue getting to know your\n partner every day.\n\n 2. Your partner can't read\n your mind. Communicate\n your needs, don't just\n think them.\n\n3. Communication creates partnership,\n but that requires\n sharing your truth with your\n partner and being open to\n recieveing theirs. Especially\n when it's uncomfortable.\n\n 4. The most romantic thing\n is being understood. But that\n requires listening actively.\n Limit all distractions when\n your partner is opening\n up to you.\n\n 5. Reveal even what feels\n risky. Let your partner see\n who you really are, not just\n what you think they want\n to see.\n\n 6. Show and tell your partner\n you love them every day. We\n all need more love than we\n lead on.\n\n",
